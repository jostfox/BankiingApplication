<h2 align="center">Let me introduce my first pet project</h2>

<h3 align = "left">Project Description: Backend Development of a Banking Microservice</h3> 

The goal of the project is to develop the backend part of a banking microservice, utilizing 
various technologies and frameworks such as Spring Boot, MySQL, Liquibase, Mockito, Swagger, AOP, Hibernate, JPA, and SLF4J.

<h3 align = "left">Objective:</h3> 
The main objective of this project is to create a robust backend microservice for banking operations 
without a frontend component. The microservice will expose a RESTful API to perform various banking 
transactions and manage customer accounts.

<h3 align = "left">Technologies:</h3> 
<text>Spring Boot: Used for application development and streamlined setup and deployment.</text> 
MySQL: Utilized as the database for storing application data. 
Liquibase: Employed for managing database migrations. 
Mockito: Utilized for creating mock objects and performing unit testing. 
Swagger: Used for documenting the API and generating interactive documentation. 
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): Implemented for cross-cutting concerns such as logging. 
Hibernate and JPA: Utilized for database interaction and object-relational mapping. 
SLF4J: Employed for logging and event registration within the application.
